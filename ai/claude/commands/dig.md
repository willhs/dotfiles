Dig youself out of this troubleshooting hole. Do the following:
1. Investigate the problem
2. Consider 5 - 7 possible causes 
3. Pick 1 - 2 that seem most likely
5. add debug logs to inspect important things
5. Rerun or ask the human to
6. Based on results either keep investigating (go back to 1.) or plan a solution (go to 6.)
7. When ready, implement solution
8. Clean up debugging
