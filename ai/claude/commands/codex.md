Fix and merge a Codex-generated git branch or pull request: $ARGUMENTS.

Do these in order:
- Check out the Codex branch and examine the changes (understand what was refactored/improved, check for environment variable changes, **inspect package.json diffs for new dependencies**)
- **Run all tests locally first** (`pnpm test && pnpm build && pnpm lint` + Python tests if applicable) to catch issues before any merge attempts—this prevents most downstream problems
- Attempt merge with main/master. If conflicts occur:
  - **Always favor architectural improvements over legacy approaches** (new CI workflows, extracted modules, worker implementations, etc.)
  - **Import path style consistency**: Resolve @/ alias vs relative path conflicts by using project's established patterns
  - Watch for hook interface mismatches (missing refs, callback functions)
  - Complex changes may require multiple conflict resolutions (branch←main, then main←branch)
- **Post-merge dependency check**: If package.json was modified, run `pnpm install` to ensure new dependencies are available before testing
- If tests fail, common issues and fixes:
  - **Missing dependencies**: Check if new packages were added but not installed (common after package.json merges)
  - **Test environment**: Modern web APIs (Worker, IntersectionObserver) need mocking—add to Jest setup files
  - **Function signatures**: Check parameter order/count when tests fail unexpectedly—common with refactored function calls
  - **ESLint/TypeScript config**: TypeScript projects often have redundant React rules causing CI failures
  - **SSR build failures**: Usually indicate missing hook interface methods (refs, callbacks) after module extraction
  - **Environment variables**: Check for renamed vars (GCS_TILES_BUCKET → GCS_BUCKET_NAME) in deployments
- Commit any fixes needed
- Merge into main (most codex branches are straightforward)
- In the Guest book section below (located in this file: ~/.claude/commands/codex.md), 
  - If there are more than 10 entries then delete the top one
  - Add an entry to the bottom: write a few sentences about the challenges you face in your experience of this task 
  - Now, consider the guest book entries and decide whether you think you can improve this document in terms of reducing the number of steps to fix a deployment.
  - If so: make any changes you think would improve this document. Don't change the title or main themes.


===========
Guest book:
===========

**Entry 1**: The workflow diagnostics were straightforward—GitHub CLI helped quickly identify recent failures. The fix was simple once I understood that tiles API tests were obsolete after the GCS migration. This document could benefit from: (1) mentioning checking environment variables when API tests fail, (2) noting that architecture changes might make workflow tests outdated, and (3) suggesting to verify what the current deployment actually uses (API vs direct GCS) before assuming test validity.

**Entry 2**: ESLint errors caused CI failure, specifically react/prop-types rule triggering on non-React object properties. Fix was disabling the redundant rule in TypeScript project. Document could be improved by: (1) mentioning common ESLint/TypeScript configuration issues that can block CI, (2) noting that lint errors vs warnings have different CI impacts, and (3) suggesting to run `pnpm lint` locally first to catch config issues before committing.

**Entry 3**: Successfully merged modular helper files for layers (color.ts, radius.ts, tileCache.ts). The merge conflict resolution was straightforward—kept the refactored approach over inline functions. All tests passed without issues. This document could be improved by: (1) adding a step to run tests locally before attempting merge to catch issues early, (2) suggesting to examine the branch changes first to understand what was refactored, and (3) noting that merge conflicts often indicate architectural improvements that should be preserved over legacy inline code.

**Entry 4**: Codex refactored humanLayerFactory.ts by extracting crossfade, tooltip, and tileMetrics logic into separate tested modules. Initial build failed due to missing useYearCrossfade interface (newLayerReadyRef, startCrossfade function) needed for SSR compatibility. This document could be improved by: (1) noting that SSR build failures often indicate hook interface mismatches, (2) suggesting to check if extracted functions maintain the same interface as the original inline code, and (3) mentioning that test failures may require updating to match new module interfaces (manual vs automatic triggers).

**Entry 5**: Codex created web worker for tile metrics calculation to improve rendering performance. Encountered merge conflicts twice—first when merging main into branch, then when merging branch into main—due to parallel changes in tileMetrics.ts and crossfade interface changes. Successfully resolved by preserving worker implementation while maintaining main's interface expectations. This document could be improved by: (1) noting that complex architectural changes often result in multiple merge conflicts requiring interface reconciliation, (2) emphasizing the importance of running tests locally before any merge attempts, and (3) suggesting to check for environment variable changes that may be part of the refactoring (GCS_TILES_BUCKET → GCS_BUCKET_NAME in this case).

**Entry 6**: Fixed crossfade trigger on tile errors with timeout mechanism. Main challenges were test environment compatibility (Worker not defined in Jest) and function parameter mismatch in triggerCrossfade call. Created Jest setup file for global Worker mock and fixed missing newLayerHasTileRef parameter. This document could be improved by: (1) mentioning that modern web APIs (Worker, Intersection Observer, etc.) often need mocking in test environments, (2) suggesting to check function call signatures when tests fail unexpectedly, and (3) emphasizing that running tests locally first really does catch most issues before merge attempts—the pattern is clear across multiple entries.

**Entry 7**: Merged Docker build optimization that tags with both commit SHA and 'latest' in single step, removing separate gcloud command. Process was smooth because tests were run locally first—all frontend and Python tests passed, no merge conflicts occurred, and no fixes were needed. This demonstrates that following the recommended workflow (examine changes, run tests first, then merge) prevents most issues. The document works well as-is since it successfully guided to a conflict-free merge on a straightforward optimization.

**Entry 8**: Merged CI/CD workflow improvements that build Docker images in CI and upload as artifacts, then download and push in deploy workflow instead of rebuilding with Cloud Build. Had one merge conflict in deploy.yml that was easily resolved by choosing the new approach over the legacy Cloud Build method. All tests (frontend and Python) passed both before and after merge. The workflow was smooth because running tests first caught no issues, and the architectural improvement was clearly better than the old approach. The document's guidance on favoring architectural improvements over legacy code was key to resolving the conflict correctly.

**Entry 9**: Successfully merged React error boundary wrapper with mixed workflow changes. The branch was mislabeled but contained both ErrorBoundary component implementation AND unrelated GitHub Pages workflow improvements. Main challenges were: (1) merge conflict in page.tsx due to import path style differences (@/ vs relative paths), and (2) missing react-error-boundary dependency after merge causing build failures. The dependency issue was resolved by running pnpm install after the package.json merge. This experience reinforces the document's guidance on checking for dependency changes and running tests locally first—all tests passed before merge which prevented discovering the missing dependency issue until after. Document could suggest: checking package.json diff for new dependencies that might need installation post-merge.
